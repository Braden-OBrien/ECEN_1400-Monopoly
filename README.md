# ECEN_1400-Monopoly
Arduino Files for Monopoly Game

This repository contains all of the program files for my Arduino Monopoly project in ECEN 1400.

Designed to work with WS1218B LED strip and LCD2004A I2C LCDs.

As the current project stands, there has been no addition of win conditions or houses/hotels.

Should run perfectly fine in the Arduino IDE, but it was primarily compiled in visualMicro for Visual Studio.
